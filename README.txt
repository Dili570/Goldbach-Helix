[ PROJECT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ]
This project represents a three-day intensive formalization of the 
Goldbach Conjecture. By treating prime 
distribution as a self-stabilizing physical system, this model maps 
prime density to a 3D Helix.

The core discovery is that "Noise" (the Minor Arcs) is a "Gap Strand" 
geometrically tethered to the "Prime Strand" (the Major Arcs) through 
Parseval’s Identity (Conservation of Energy).

[ STRUCTURAL LOGIC: THE DNA ANALOGY ]
Applying a background in construction and abstract geometry, this model 
treats the number line as a physical assembly:

* THE PRIME STRAND: A load-bearing signal established with a lower bound 
  scaling of N / log^2 N.
  
* THE GAP STRAND: A complementary strand defined as the geometric 
  inverse of the Prime Strand.
  
* STRAND INTEGRITY: Just as a DNA helix maintains its shape through 
  balanced tension, the Goldbach structure is held together by energy 
  conservation.
  
* THE MUTATION CHECK: A verified theorem proving that for a Goldbach 
  failure (a "Void") to occur, the Gap Strand would need to possess more 
  energy than the total system allows.

[ THE "BASE CAMP" EVOLUTION ]
