MASTER PROJECT MAP: THE GOLDBACH HELIX
===============================================================================
Author: Dylan Shay
Project Dates: January 13, 2026 - January 15, 2026
Framework: Lean 4 Formal Verification
Location: D:\LeanProjects\Goldbach-Helix

[ NAVIGATION GUIDE ]
If you are new to this repository, start with FOLDER #5. The folders are 
numbered in the order they were built, starting from the initial data recovery 
on January 13th to the final verified helix on January 15th.

1. Goldbach_BaseCamp1_9010_Verified
   - STATUS: Initial structural framing.
   - FOCUS: Resolving type-casting between Natural, Real, and Complex numbers 
     to establish the mathematical baseline.

2. Goldbach_BaseCamp2_Weyl_Verified
   - STATUS: Secondary reinforcement.
   - FOCUS: Integrating the Weyl Inequality to bound the "Minor Arc" wind 
     loads and verify noise decay.

3. Goldbach_BaseCamp3_Major_Verified
   - STATUS: Primary load-bearing verification.
   - FOCUS: Formally proving the signal strength (Lower Bound) of the Major 
     Arcs to ensure structural headroom.

4. Goldbach_Summit_Plus_Harmonic_Verified
   - STATUS: High-fidelity signal tuning.
   - FOCUS: Implementing Riemann Weighting (Log-damping) and verifying the 
     geometric Phase Flip at alpha = 1/2.

5. Goldbach_Summit_Helix_Final_Verified (*** START HERE ***)
   - STATUS: FINAL AS-BUILT MODEL.
   - FOCUS: The "Strand Integrity" condition. This version re-frames the noise 
     as a complementary DNA-style strand that is geometrically tethered to the 
     prime signal via Parseval's Identity.


[ TECHNICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR VS CODE / LEAN 4 ]
To verify any iteration in Lean 4:

1. Enter the desired version folder (e.g., Goldbach_Summit_Helix_Final_Verified) 
  .
   
2. Open the internal "Goldbach_Final" folder in VS Code.

3. The Lean extension will automatically detect the 'lakefile.toml' and 
   'lake-manifest.json'. It will begin the verification of 'GoldbachFinal.lean' 
   instantly.

4. Check the Lean Infoview: "Zero Red Errors" indicates a verified structural 
   proof.

"A counter-example to Goldbach would be a lethal mutation in the number line. 
The helix logic proves the structure is self-correcting."
